nimbic TODO / notes

Translate JSON to HTML table, htmlout directory
bic sqlite export and repack
--inplace option to keep json in folder with bic
search by pattern support for subfolders
autobackup bic with timestamp, set timestamp at operation start so every change uses the same TS
--production config setting
--restorebic option that accepts foldername and/or timestamp to restore backup .bic
--cleanup option to remove old backups
original path/sqlite file name/etc could be stored within the JSON and then deleted prior to conversion to GFF


Ugly down here
Skills - refund
Refund individual skill by returning spent points to SkillPoints object and LvlStatList > i > SkillPoints. 
Use class id and skill index to find if skill cost 1 or 2 points per rank

Skills - revoke - TEST FIRST WITH 2DA
Follows refund procedure but also deletes nodes associated with skill if skill is 'banned'

Skills - create - TEST FIRST WITH 2DA
Create skill nodes in skill list and lvlstatlist with rank 0 for a newly created skill

Class - Adjust skill points per Level - positive only. Negative would require interfering with spent points.
If BaseInt <
Points per level = GetClassSkillsPerLevel + RaceExtraSkills + IntMod
	IntMod = BaseInt + IntAtLevel(Account for Int from RDD, GreatInt, Ability increases)
   BaseInt = Int - IntFromLevels(Feat) - IntFromLevels(Abilities) - IntFromClass(cls_stat table)
