Skills - refund
Refund individual skill by returning spent points to SkillPoints object and LvlStatList > i > SkillPoints. 
Use class id and skill index to find if skill cost 1 or 2 points per rank

Skills - revoke - TEST FIRST WITH 2DA
Follows refund procedure but also deletes nodes associated with skill if skill is 'banned'

Skills - create - TEST FIRST WITH 2DA
Create skill nodes in skill list and lvlstatlist with rank 0 for a newly created skill

Class - Adjust skill points per Level - positive only. Negative would require interfering with spent points.
If BaseInt <
Points per level = GetClassSkillsPerLevel + RaceExtraSkills + IntMod
	IntMod = BaseInt + IntAtLevel(Account for Int from RDD, GreatInt, Ability increases)
   BaseInt = Int - IntFromLevels(Feat) - IntFromLevels(Abilities) - IntFromClass(cls_stat table)
