# nimbic_system
## A command-line utility for modifying Neverwinter Nights' .bic character files. Since it is directory driven it is intended to modify entire character vaults or server vaults in a single operation - such as retrofitting server-level 2DA changes onto the server's characters without requiring them to be relevelled or invalidated.
